# Prompt used to generate sample data for invoices

'''
help me create 30 sets of sample data to generate fake invoices for a business for testing an ML OCR reader. I need sample data in the following format:
[[
            ('S.No', 'Item Description', 'Items', 'Cost'),
            ('1', 'Chocolate Cake(1 Kg) ', '1', '895.00'),
            ('2', 'Flower Bookie', '1', '500.50'),
            ('3', 'Rat Poisen(500ml)', '1', ' 50.50')
]]
where every list in the list consist of the exact same first line "('S.No', 'Item Description', 'Items', 'Cost')", and then between 1 to 5 other items containing the S.No, Item Description, Items (which is the item number), and the total cost.

Ensure that the item description contains items that fall into one of these categories, but do not include the category name itself in the line item: Payroll & Benefits, Office & Utilities, Marketing & Advertising, Office Supplies & Equip., Travel & Transport, Professional Services, Insurance, Repairs & Maintenance, Software & Subscriptions, Food
